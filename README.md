## **Hello, I'm Nathan!** :octocat:

#### I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer in Northern Virginia, USA. I'm currently a student at Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program, but also do plenty of additional studying (YouTube, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, and large amounts of MDN). While I have so much more to learn, I'm eager to join a group of like-minded individuals and put my skills to the test.
