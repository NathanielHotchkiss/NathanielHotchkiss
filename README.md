## **Hello, I'm Nathan!** :octocat:

#### I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer in Northern Virginia, currently attending Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program. I enjoy coding and the challenges it presents. While I have so much more to learn, I'm eager to join a group of like-minded individuals and put my skills to the test.
